# Text_to_binary
A C++ program that converts lowercase text into 5-bit binary code. Users input any text, and the program translates each letter (a-z) into a corresponding binary value, displaying the result with spaces. Ideal for learning basic encoding, programming, and text-to-binary conversion techniques.
